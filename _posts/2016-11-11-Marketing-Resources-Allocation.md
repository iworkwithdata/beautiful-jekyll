# Case Study 1
Payroll, Inc offers a software platform to manage employee compensation processes, but isn't sure just how much to invest to revamp their website, strengthen their social media presence, and institute paid search advertising. What should Payroll consider about sales attribution before investing?

Sales cannot be directly attributed to one point of customer interaction, at which a majority of investment could be directed. A deeper investigation is required to identify the relationship between different points of interaction through the customer journey.

# Case Study 2
Office Lunches, a catering company, found that sales calls convert to legitimate demand; however, the Chief Marketing Officer has set a maximum number of sales calls per month. Her sales team is confused about why she's limited the number of calls. She explains that she used marketing analytics to determine that the cost of making sales calls would exceed the profits from the demand generated. 

She used the formula (Profit = Sales*Gross Margin% - Marketing Costs) to determine the optimum point, beyond which sales would not increase proportional to the cost of sales calls.

# Unit Price and Sales
These two elements demonstrate an empirical relationship because for a given change in price, we cannot determine the change in sales. It can only be predicted by analyzing historical data--and then observed in the market place.
